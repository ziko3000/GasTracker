### Installing Nodemon on Linux

[Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) is a utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server, perfect for development. Follow these steps to install it on Linux:

1. To install Nodemon globally (available to all your Node.js projects), you can run:

    ```bash
    npm install -g nodemon
    ```

    If you're facing permission issues, you may need to prepend `sudo`:

    ```bash
    sudo npm install -g nodemon
    ```

That's it! You've successfully installed Nodemon on your Linux machine. Now, you can use the `nodemon` command to run your bot:

```bash
    nodemon src/bot.ts
```    
## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

This bot supports the following Slash commands:

- `/gas`: Get Ethereum gas prices
- `/help`: Get help about the bot and its commands.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Adding Commands <a name = "adding_commands"></a>

To add a new command:

1. Create a new command file in the `commands` folder, like `mycommand.ts`.
2. Define your command as a class with `name`, `description`, and `execute` method.
3. Import your command class in `CommandHandler.ts` and register it in the constructor.

For example:

```typescript
import { MyCommand } from './mycommand';

// In CommandHandler constructor
this.registerCommand('mycommand', 'This is my command', (interaction) => new MyCommand().execute(interaction));
```
